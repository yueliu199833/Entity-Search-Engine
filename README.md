# Entity search
Entity Search System
Expectations from this project is to
● Build an entity search system that take an input and return X number of similar or matching entities (coming up with X is up to you - it can be based on confidence score, static, or all)
● Consider scenarios that this search system should be able to handle and what the expected behavior is.
○ For example, if your system handles typo, briefly explain what the expected behavior is.
■ Berkshire → Berkshire Hathaway, Berkshire Hills Bancorp, ...
■ Barkshire → Berkshire Hathaway, ...
○ If there are any other cases that your system handles, also briefly explain what
the case is and what the expected behavior is
Data
● Use this publicly available public company data:

Testing & Evaluation
● Define key evaluation metrics. For example,
○ Recall % of relevant records
○ Rankings of search results
○ (if you implemented confidence score) performance metrics of confidence scores
○ Any other key metrics you think are relevant and important to measure the
performance of your system
